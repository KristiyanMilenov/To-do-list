# To-do-list
My program basically creates a to do list for you automatically sorting all tasks by urgency level(high to low)
You put all tasks ahead of you in the far or near future and the program will give them an urgency level and sort them 
High urgency if the due date is 2 or less days
Medium urgency if the due date is 5 or less days
Else it is low urgency
In order for the program to work the file should be named tasks.txt and the tasks should be formated as follows:
Name,YY-MM-DD
When you run the program an empty window appears with a button at the bottom that says load tasks which when clicked takes the tasks out of the file sorts them and presents them to you in the window while giving them the above mentioned urgency level rating.
The file should be created in the folder with the program in order to work
